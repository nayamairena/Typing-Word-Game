To compile the program use the Makefile:  
`make typing_word_game`

Then to run the program:  
`./typing_word_game`

The program will randomize the phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and display one word at a time for you to enter. The word must be exactly the same, it is case-sensitive. After you finish the phrase, it will give you the time it took for you to complete. It will ask if you'd like to play again.  
The typescript file shows an example run of the program.
